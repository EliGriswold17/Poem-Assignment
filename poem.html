        <h1>Stopping by Woods On a Snowy Evening</h1>
        <h2>By Robert Frost</h2>

        <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.   
            His house is in the village though;   
            He will not see me stopping here   
            To watch his woods fill up with snow.  </p>
        
        
        <div class="background2">
           
        </div>

        <p>My little horse must think it queer   
            To stop without a farmhouse near   
            Between the woods and frozen lake   
            The darkest evening of the year. </p>
        
        
        <div class="background3">
           
        </div>

      <p>He gives his harness bells a shake   
            To ask if there is some mistake.   
            The only other soundâ€™s the sweep   
            Of easy wind and downy flake. </p>  
        
        <div class="background4">
           
        </div>
            
        <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
                But I have promises to keep,   
                And miles to go before I sleep,   
                And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
